Let S be an array of size ‘n’ and elements in S are positive integers . Write a PAC,  algorithm/pseudocode and subsequent Java code to sort the array in increasing order based on the frequency of the values. 
If two numbers have the same frequency then the smallest number first  followed by other number in the sorted array.  
For example, Input: S = [1,1,2,2,2,3] and your program produces output: S=[3,1,1,2,2,2]. One more example, your produces output [3,1, 1, 2, 2] 
if S=[1, 2, 3, 1, 2] .


Input
5
2 1 2 1 2
Expected output
1 1 2 2 2
