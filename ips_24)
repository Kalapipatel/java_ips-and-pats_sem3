IPS-24
Write a PAC, Pseudocode/Algorithm and a Java program for the below problem:

In a country, people believe that having vowels in their names brings bad luck. More the number of vowels, more is the bad luck. So, they mention their names without vowels by replacing them with the next character of vowel (ie., a is replaced as b, e is replaced as f and so on). Given a name, display the new name after replacement and the level (count) of bad luck.

For example, the name rajkumar is changed to rbjkvmbr and the level is 3.
