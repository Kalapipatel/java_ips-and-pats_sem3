PAT:-4
XYZ software company has recently revised the salary structure of all the employees. The employees of the company are broadly categorized into two groups namely Project Managers and System Engineers.

Get the Basic pay and apply the allowances such as Additional Grade Pay (40% AGP), Dearness allowances (80% DA), Travel Allowances (20% TA) and House Rental allowances (40% HRA) based on the below 2 options.

Using a switch-case to get the options for Project Manager (Case-1) and System Engineer (Case-2). Print "Invalid" for any other case options.

Else compute the salary for Project Manager and System Engineer where,

• Project Manager enjoys all the allowances offered by the company along with basic pay except TA.

• System Engineer gets only basic pay and TA.

Incorporate this salary scheme in a Java Program through a method or function overloading concept to calculate the salary for the employees in the company.Also, write PAC, pseudocode/Algorithm for this problem.

Input Format:

Basic pay

Option value (Either 1 or 2)

Output Format:

Total salary

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

pseudocode:

step 1:
read basic pay(np)

step 2:
read choise(choise)

step 3:
make a class called revised for revised salary calculation

step 4:
make 1 method called salary which calculated revised salary of the employee

step 5:
give different parameters for function overloading
then call the function according to cases

step 6:
if case 1 --> then print the salary of project managers
salary = bp + (bp*agp) + (bp*da) + (bp*hra);
else if case 2 --> then print the salaey of system engineers
salary = bp + (bp * ta)

step 7:
display the revised salary

        double k = bp + (bp*agp) + (bp*da) + (bp*hra);
        System.out.format("%.1f",k);
