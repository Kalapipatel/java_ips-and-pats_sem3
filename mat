Position in arrays – CT2
Write a PAC, Pseudocode/Algorithm and a Java program to implement the below problem:

Given the value of ‘n’ distinct integers, create two arrays based on the number of integers (‘n’). If the ‘n’ is even, then form the first array with the first n/2 integers and the second array with the remaining elements. If ‘n’ is odd, then form the first array with first (n/2+1) integers and second array with the remaining elements.

Sort both the arrays in an ascending order separately and name the first sorted array as A and the second sorted array as B. Merge both the arrays A and B, and create a new array called C such that all the elements of A & B are in C and the elements are in an ascending order.

Read a number k, check and display whether k is present in the array A or B, the position of k in A (or B) and the position of k in C. If k is not present in any of the arrays A or B, your code should output -1.

Input format :

Enter the number of numbers: n

Enter the first number

Enter the second number :

.....

Enter the n-th number

Enter the number to be checked : k

 

Output format :

Print  A if k is present in A or print B is present in the array B or print -1 if k is not present in both the arrays A & B

Print the position of k in the array A (or B)

Print the position of k in the array C
